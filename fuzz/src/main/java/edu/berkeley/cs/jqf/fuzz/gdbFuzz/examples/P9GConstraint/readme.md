# Constraint algorithm
**Functionality** \
This algorithm verifies whether after a change of the database the constraint of how many relations there are is maintained. 

Is this a good example? First of all is this a check which is mostly dependent on the update and not on the DB/DB schema.

**Motivation** \ 
The code from which the example is based can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/Novo-Nordisk/nn-public/openstudybuilder/OpenStudyBuilder-Solution/-/blob/main/clinical-mdr-api/clinical_mdr_api/domain_repositories/generic_repository.py?ref_type=heads).
