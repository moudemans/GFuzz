**Motivation** \
The below program has been collected from the following github [repository](https://github.com/jpjarnoux/PanGraph-DB).

The repositoy implements a pipeline which operates on a unified graph dataset consisting of multiple pangenome graphs, a software suite used to create and manipulate prokaryotic pangenomes from a set of either genomic DNA sequences or provided genome annotations.
The repository uses the Neo4J graph database to perform complex analysises. 

The schema which is used:
