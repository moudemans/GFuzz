# VF2 algorithm

**Motivation** \
This example has been retrieved from a [github](https://github.com/pfllo/VF2) repository with 25 stars. The repository has some dummy queries which show the performance of the algorith. Applying all queries to the application results in a coverage of 95%.

Below some specific coverages for the different inputs:

- Maximum coverage with Q20: 87%
- Maximum coverage with Q24: 93%
- Maximum coverage with all queries: 95% 126/132
- Maximum coverage with QManual (extracted 6 DB states):  95% 126/132
- Maximum coverage with Gmark: 90%, 120/132
