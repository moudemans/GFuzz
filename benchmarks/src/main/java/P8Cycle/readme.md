# Cycle algorithm
**Functionality** \
This algorithm goes over every edge and looks for a cycle in the graph. The cycle has to be at least of size x in order to execute further logic.****


**Motivation** \
The algorithm has been inspired by the [common graph problems in 2024]( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-50-graph-coding-problems-for-interviews ). 
Most of the existing cycle algorithm's are less prone to bugs as it is usually based on going over edges/nodes without a lot of code logic or branching.
This example shows how the coverage tools are able to reach hard patterns like a graph cycle of x. 

Possible examples of such an example would be:
- Check for malicious transactions where the money is eventually returned to the original account
- Check whether there is in a chain of dependencies at least 1 quality check every y steps.
