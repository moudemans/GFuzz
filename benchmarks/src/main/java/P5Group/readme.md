# group algorithm
**Functionality** \
The algorithm receives a list of group names and a graph. Each group has a group name and group members. If the group already exists it is extended with the group members not mentioned in the function parameter. Additioally, any subgroup members are added through a recursive call.

_Does not seem to have a lot of branching...._
