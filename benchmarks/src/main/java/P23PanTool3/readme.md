**Motivation** \
The below program has been collected from the following gitlab [repository](https://git.wur.nl/bioinformatics/pantools/-/tree/pantools_v4?ref_type=heads).

The repo has a large code base with 10s of packages and 10s of thousands lines of code. We selected a method (retrieve_gene_seq_check_presence_hmgroup) from the Phylogene.java file which collects a lot of statistics about genes that were found per gene.
